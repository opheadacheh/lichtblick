External contributors do not have write access to the repository. To contribute, you must **fork** the project and open a Pull Request from your fork:

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/lichtblick.git
   cd lichtblick
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote** (to keep your fork up to date):

   ```sh
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/lichtblick-suite/lichtblick.git
   ```

### For internal team members

Core team members with write access can clone the repository directly and create branches following the [Branching Strategy](#branching-strategy---git-flow):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lichtblick-suite/lichtblick.git
cd lichtblick
```

### Setup

1. **Enable Corepack** and install dependencies:

   ```sh

## Component Structure

To ensure consistency, scalability, and a clear separation of concerns, all React components should follow the structure outlined below.

### File organization per component

| File / Directory         | Purpose                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.tsx`              | Entry point — manages exports and provides a simplified integration interface             |
| `ComponentName.tsx`      | Primary logic and rendering of the component                                              |
| `ComponentName.test.tsx` | Unit tests for the component                                                              |
| `ComponentName.style.ts` | Styles specific to the component (using [tss-react](https://www.tss-react.dev/))          |
| `types.ts`               | TypeScript type definitions, interfaces, and enums for the component                      |
| `constants.ts`           | Constants specific to the component (avoids magic numbers and scattered hardcoded values) |
| `hooks/`                 | Custom hooks related to the component (e.g., `useComponentData.ts`)                       |
| `builders/`              | Builder classes for creating mock data, test props, and reusable configurations           |
| `utils/`                 | Utility functions specific to the component                                               |
| `shared/`                | Shared functionalities reusable across sibling components                                 |

### Example directory tree

```
panels/
├── Plot/
│   ├── index.tsx                        # Entry point for exposing the component
│   ├── Plot.tsx                         # Primary logic and rendering
│   ├── Plot.style.ts                    # Styles specific to the Plot component
│   ├── Plot.test.tsx                    # Unit tests for the Plot component
│   ├── PlotLegend.tsx                   # Sub-component: logic and rendering
│   ├── PlotLegend.style.ts             # Styles for the PlotLegend sub-component
│   ├── PlotLegend.test.tsx             # Unit tests for the PlotLegend sub-component
│   ├── types.ts                         # Contracts/Schemas for Plot components
│   ├── constants.ts                     # Constants specific to Plot components
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── usePlotData.ts              # Custom hook for the Plot component
│   │   └── usePlotData.test.ts         # Unit tests for the hook
│   ├── builders/
│   │   ├── PlotBuilder.ts              # Builder for mock data and test props
│   │   └── PlotBuilder.test.ts         # Unit tests for the builder
│   └── utils/
│       ├── formatPlotValues.ts          # Utility function for the Plot component
│       └── formatPlotValues.test.ts     # Unit tests for the utility
└── shared/
    ├── formatDate.ts                    # Shared function across panel components
    └── formatDate.test.ts              # Unit tests for the shared function
```

### Key principles

- **`index.tsx`** should focus exclusively on managing exports. Primary component logic belongs in `ComponentName.tsx`.
- **`types.ts`** centralizes type definitions, making them easily accessible and reusable.
- **`constants.ts`** and **`*.style.ts`** files can be excluded from code coverage tools (e.g., SonarQube) to focus metrics on relevant files.
- **Builders** follow the [Builder pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder) to simplify creation of complex objects step-by-step — especially useful for test setups.
- **`shared/`** promotes reusability across sibling components and reduces duplication of common logic.

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a branch

- **Internal team:** Create a branch directly in the repository following the [Branching Strategy](#branching-strategy---git-flow). Always branch off `develop` for features and bugfixes.
- **Community contributors:** Create a branch in your **fork**. When opening a PR, target the `develop` branch of the upstream repository.

### 2. Make your changes

- Write clean, well-documented TypeScript code.
- Follow the [Code Style & Standards](#art-code-style--standards) and [Component Structure](#component-structure).
- Add or update unit tests for your changes.
- If your change affects the UI, verify it in both **web** and **desktop** modes.

### 3. Validate locally

Before pushing, ensure your changes pass all checks:

```sh
yarn lint                   # Linting (ESLint + Prettier)
yarn test                   # Unit tests (Jest)
yarn run tsc --noEmit       # TypeScript type checking
```

### 4. Open a Pull Request

- **Community contributors:** Open a PR **from your fork** targeting the `develop` branch of the upstream repository.
- **Internal team:** Open a PR directly in the repository targeting `develop` for features/bugfixes, or `main` for `release/major/`, `release/minor/`, and `hotfix/` branches.
- Fill in the [PR template](#pull-request-guidelines) completely.
- Ensure CI checks pass.

---

## Branching Strategy - Git flow

Branch naming is **enforced by CI**. PRs with non-compliant branch names will be automatically rejected.

### Targeting `develop`

| Prefix        | Purpose                                  | Example                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `feature/`    | New features or significant improvements | `feature/user-authentication` |
| `bugfix/`     | Non-critical bug fixes                   | `bugfix/fix-login-redirect`   |
| `dependabot/` | Automated dependency updates             | _(auto-generated)_            |

### Targeting `main`

| Prefix           | Purpose                                                            | Example                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `release/major/` | Major production releases (breaking changes or reworked APIs)      | `release/major/2.0.0`   |
| `release/minor/` | Minor production releases (new functionality, no breaking changes) | `release/minor/1.3.0`   |
| `hotfix/`        | Urgent critical fixes                                              | `hotfix/security-patch` |

---

## Code Style & Standards

Code quality is enforced through automated tooling. All checks run in CI and must pass before merging.

### Formatting

- **Prettier** is used for code formatting with a `printWidth` of **100** characters.
- Prettier runs automatically as part of linting in CI.

### Linting

- **ESLint** with the `@lichtblick` plugin suite enforces consistent code patterns.
- Run `yarn lint` to auto-fix issues locally (Prettier integration is disabled locally to speed up linting, but enforced in CI).

### TypeScript Conventions

- **Strict mode** is enabled — avoid `any` types where possible.
- Prefer `undefined` over `null`. When required for React refs, use the `ReactNull` alias.
- Do not use property getters or setters — use function syntax instead.
- Unused variables must have a `_` prefix (e.g., `_unusedParam`).
- Avoid `@emotion/styled` and MUI's `styled`/`sx`/`Box` — use **tss-react/mui** for styling instead.
- Use `@lichtblick/den/async` `race` instead of `Promise.race` (see [V8 bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=9858)).
- Allowed console methods: `console.warn`, `console.error`, `console.debug`, `console.assert`.

### License Headers

All source files must include the **MPL-2.0** license header. This is enforced by ESLint via the `@lichtblick/license-header` rule.

### File Organization

- Keep constants in `constants.ts`, types in `types.ts`, and styles in `*.style.ts` files.
- Organize styles using [tss-react](https://www.tss-react.dev/).
- See the [Component Structure](#component-structure) section for a complete reference.

## Testing

### General Principles

- All tests should follow the **Given-When-Then (GWT)** structure for improved readability and maintainability. This pattern is used consistently across both unit and E2E tests.
- Use **reusable mock builders** to create test data instead of manually setting up mocks in each test. Builders are centralized in `builders/` directories and provide consistent, flexible, and configurable data for all test levels.

### Mock Builders

The project uses a **Builder pattern** to streamline the creation of test data across unit, integration, and E2E tests:

```
/testing
├── builders/
│   ├── BasicBuilder.ts         # Basic mocks (dates, strings, lists, floats, etc.)
│   └── EntityBuilder.ts        # Mocks for specific application entities
```

- **`BasicBuilder`** provides foundational mock data types.
- **Entity builders** generate consistent domain-specific mock data.
- Component-specific builders live in the component's own `builders/` directory (see [Component Structure](#component-structure)).

### Unit Tests (Jest)

- All new features and bug fixes should be covered by unit tests.
- Tests are located alongside source files with the `.test.ts` / `.test.tsx` extension.
- Run tests:

  ```sh
  yarn test                   # Run all tests
  yarn test:watch             # Run tests on changed files
  yarn test:coverage          # Run tests with coverage report
  yarn test:debug             # Run tests with debugger attached
  ```

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

E2E tests cover both desktop (Electron) and web versions, with the following strategy:

- **Primary focus on desktop testing** — The desktop version is the final stage of the software, so the majority of E2E tests target it.
- **Web-specific tests only when necessary** — Tests are written for the web version only when there is a distinct behavior that needs separate validation.
- **Shared test architecture** — Page Object Models (POM) and helper functions are reused across both platforms.
- **Playwright** is the chosen E2E framework.

#### Filename pattern

```
{feature-name}.{platform}.spec.ts
```

Example: `install-multiple-extensions.web.spec.ts`

#### E2E directory structure

```
e2e/
├── tests/
│   ├── desktop/                          # Desktop E2E tests
│   │   ├── open-files/
│   │   │   └── open-mcap-via-ui.desktop.spec.ts
│   │   ├── sidebar/
│   │   ├── layout/
│   │   ├── extension/
│   │   ├── panel/
│   │   ├── utils/                        # Shared desktop test utilities
│   │   └── playwright.config.ts          # Desktop Playwright configuration
│   └── web/                              # Web E2E tests
│       ├── open-files/
│       │   └── open-mcap-via-url.web.spec.ts
│       ├── utils/
│       └── playwright.config.ts          # Web Playwright configuration
├── fixtures/                             # Test fixtures and data mocks
└── helpers/                              # Generic test helper functions
```

#### Running E2E tests

```sh
yarn test:e2e:desktop           # Desktop E2E tests
yarn test:e2e:web               # Web E2E tests
yarn test:e2e:desktop:debug     # Desktop E2E with debug mode
yarn test:e2e:web:debug         # Web E2E with debug mode
```

### CI Pipeline

## AI-Assisted Development

The project uses **GitHub Copilot agent mode** (VS Code 1.99+) with project-specific agents and skills to accelerate development workflows. AI agents are configured via Markdown files in `.github/` and operate within clearly defined conventions.

### Available Agents

| Agent | Invocation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Lichtblick E2E Test` | `@lb-e2e-test` | Creates Playwright E2E tests for desktop (Electron) and web, using the Playwright MCP browser for web UI exploration |

### Skills

Skills are reusable domain knowledge files loaded by agents before performing tasks:

| Skill | Location | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test-conventions` | `.github/skills/test-conventions/SKILL.md` | GWT pattern, quality rules, and test-writing workflow for all test types |
| `e2e-playwright-mcp` | `.github/skills/e2e-playwright-mcp/SKILL.md` | E2E-specific: fixture reference, selector strategy, MCP usage, and source instrumentation |

### Global Context

`.github/copilot-instructions.md` is auto-loaded at the start of every Copilot Chat session. It defines project-wide rules for code style, testing, and available agents.

### Playwright MCP Server

The Playwright MCP server (configured in `.vscode/mcp.json`) enables AI agents to explore the running web app via accessibility snapshots, discover stable selectors, and generate test scaffolds interactively.

> **Note**: The MCP server drives Chrome (web) only — it cannot automate the Electron desktop app. See `e2e/README.md` for detailed workflow documentation.

## Pull Request Guidelines

> :lock: **Direct PRs to the repository** are restricted to the internal development team. Community contributors must submit PRs **from a fork** of the repository. All contributions — internal and external — follow the same review and CI requirements.

When opening a PR, fill in the template provided:

### Required checklist

- [ ] The **web version** was tested and is running correctly
- [ ] The **desktop version** was tested and is running correctly
- [ ] Changes are covered by **unit tests**
- [ ] Files `constants.ts`, `types.ts`, and `*.style.ts` have been checked — relevant code snippets have been relocated appropriately

### PR best practices

- **Title:** Use a clear, descriptive title summarizing the change.
- **User-Facing Changes:** Describe changes visible to end users — this will be used as a changelog entry.
- **Description:** Link relevant GitHub issues. Add the `docs` label if documentation updates are needed.
- **Size:** Keep PRs focused. Smaller PRs are reviewed faster and have fewer merge conflicts.
- **Reviewers:** PRs require at least one approving review before merging.

---

## Reporting Issues

- **Bug reports:** Use the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/lichtblick-suite/lichtblick/issues/new?template=bug.md) on GitHub.
- **Feature requests:** Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/lichtblick-suite/lichtblick/discussions/new/choose) in the repository.
- **Questions:** Search existing [Discussions](https://github.com/lichtblick-suite/lichtblick/discussions) or ask on [Robotics Stack Exchange](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/ask).

When reporting a bug, please include:

- Lichtblick version
- Platform (OS, browser, desktop)
- Data source type (e.g., MCAP file, ROS 1/2 native, rosbridge)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior

---

## Version Increment

The version format: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. Version bumps are **determined automatically** by the CI release workflow based on the branch name used:

| Component | Branch Prefix    | Description                                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MAJOR** | `release/major/` | Breaking changes — removed or reworked APIs. Users should expect a non-trivial update. |
| **MINOR** | `release/minor/` | New functionality added without breaking backward compatibility.                       |
| **PATCH** | `hotfix/`        | Bug fixes, security patches, and minor improvements.                                   |

- We value **high-quality** translations over complete coverage. Every PR must have up-to-date **English** translations, but updating other languages is optional.
- If you update an English translation and cannot provide accurate non-English translations, **delete the outdated non-English versions** in your PR. Optionally, open follow-up PRs with accurate translations.

### Translation files

The [`i18n` directory](packages/suite-base/src/i18n) contains translated strings organized by **namespaces** — e.g., [`i18n/en/appSettings.ts`](packages/suite-base/src/i18n/en/appSettings.ts) contains translations for the Settings tab.

### Using translations in components

1. Call the [`useTranslation(namespace)`](https://react.i18next.com/latest/usetranslation-hook) hook to get the `t` function.
2. Use `t("key")` to render translated strings.
3. Use `camelCase` for all new localization keys.

### Adding localization to a component

<table><tr><th>Before</th><th>After</th></tr><tr><td>

```ts
function MyComponent() {
  return <p>Hello!</p>;
}
```

</td><td>

```ts
function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation("myComponent");
  return <p>{t("hello")}</p>;
}
```

```ts
// i18n/en/myComponent.ts
export const myComponent = {
  hello: "Hello!",
};
```

</td></tr></table>

### Complete example

```ts
// MyComponent.ts
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

function MyComponent(props: Props): React.JSX.Element {
  const { t } = useTranslation("myComponent");
  return <p>{t("hello")}</p>;
}
```

```ts
// i18n/en/myComponent.ts
export const myComponent = {
  hello: "Hello!",
};

// i18n/en/index.ts
export * from "./myComponent";
```

```ts
// i18n/zh/myComponent.ts
export const myComponent: Partial<TypeOptions["resources"]["myComponent"]> = {
  hello: "你好！",
};

// i18n/zh/index.ts
export * from "./myComponent";
```

| English         | Chinese         |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| `<p>Hello!</p>` | `<p>你好！</p>` |
