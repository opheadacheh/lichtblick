## Global Rules

### General Principles

- **Be concise**: Prefer short, focused responses
- **Context-aware**: Check existing patterns in the codebase before suggesting changes
- **Follow existing conventions**: Match the style and structure of surrounding code
- **No breaking changes**: Preserve existing APIs and interfaces unless explicitly asked
- **Security first**: Never hardcode secrets, credentials, or sensitive data
- **Open-source**: All contributions must be compliant with the MPL-2.0 license

### Code Quality

- **Type safety**: Use TypeScript strict mode — avoid `any`; prefer `undefined` over `null`
- **Error handling**: Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages
- **No `console.log`**: Use `console.warn`, `console.error`, `console.debug`, `console.assert` only
- **License headers**: All source files must include the MPL-2.0 SPDX header

### Formatting (enforced by Prettier + ESLint)

- **Print width**: 100 characters
- **Quotes**: Double quotes
- **Semicolons**: Yes
- **Trailing commas**: All
- **Line endings**: LF

> Full code style standards are documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Package Manager

- **Yarn 3.6.3** via Corepack (do not use npm or pnpm)
- Enable with: `corepack enable`

### Key Commands

```bash
yarn web:serve               # Start web dev server (http://localhost:8080/viz/)
yarn desktop:serve           # Start webpack for Electron
yarn desktop:start           # Launch Electron app (requires desktop:serve)
yarn test                    # All unit tests (Jest)
yarn test:watch              # Watch mode
yarn test:coverage           # Unit tests with coverage
yarn lint                    # ESLint + Prettier
yarn test:e2e:web            # Web E2E tests (Playwright)
yarn test:e2e:desktop        # Desktop E2E tests (Playwright + Electron)
```

---

## Testing Standards

All tests follow the **Given-When-Then (GWT)** pattern. See the
[test-conventions skill](.github/skills/test-conventions/SKILL.md) for full rules.

- **Unit tests**: Jest, co-located with source (`.test.ts` / `.test.tsx`)
- **E2E tests**: Playwright — desktop (Electron) primary, web for distinct behaviors only
- **Mock builders**: Use builders from `testing/builders/` and component-specific `builders/` directories
- **Coverage target**: 80%+ on business logic

---

## Styling

- Use **tss-react/mui** for all component styles
- Never use `@emotion/styled`, MUI's `styled()`, `Box`, or `sx` prop
- Styles live in `ComponentName.style.ts` files

---

## Available Agents

Use these agents in Copilot Chat for specialized tasks:

| Agent name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `@lb-e2e-test` | Create Playwright E2E tests using the Playwright MCP browser |

Agents are defined in `.github/agents/`.
Skills are defined in `.github/skills/`.

## Ask Before Acting When

- Making architectural changes to `packages/suite-base/`
- Adding new external dependencies
- Changing public component APIs
- Modifying the build configuration or CI pipeline
